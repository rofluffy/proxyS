=== GRADE DETAILS ===


PART 1  SIMPLE PROXY SERVER and overall functionality [36/40]

[0/2] Checks return values of all system and library calls and deals
with failures. (Typical examples are checking for null on a call to malloc, -ve values for things like accept, listen, connect, socket) 

[ /1]   Uses passed in parameter to create port on to accept connection
[0/2]    Prints the reply header (only needs to print the line with the 
        code, but more is OK)
[ /2]	Can properly retrieve a small page
[ /2]	Can properly retrieve a large page that ends by a read of an EOF
[ /3]	Can properly retrieve a page that uses content-length to specify 
        the page length
[ /3]	Can properly retrieve a pages that uses chunked encoding. (Make 
        sure that the chunk sizes are passed to the client)
[ /2]	Can retrieve a page from a server that isn't running on port 80

[ /2]	Can deal with connecting to a port that doesn't support HTTP for
        example connect to www.cs.ubc.ca:443 (Effectively results in an 
        unexpected EOF while waiting for the reply)
[ /2]	Can accept an improper reply without crashing (i.e. gets data but
        not a response)  
[ /2]	If using malloc has appropriate matching frees. 
[ /2]	Rejects HTTP requests that are not gets
[ /2]    Handles case when host refuses connection or the connection times
        out
[ /2]    Closes connection when done and does appropriate cleanup
[ /2]	Can deal with short reads - especially while reading 
        the request from the client and the response from the server
[ /1]    Forwards full get request and all headers to server
[ /1]	Handles unexpected closes (once data has started to be collected)
[ /2]	Can deal with binary data in the response body
[ /2]    Handles short writes
[ /3]    Choice of algorithms, proper use of system and library calls etc.

PART 2 Filtering Hosts [8/10]

[ /1]	Opens filter file based on provided parameter
[0/2]	Reads file only once, not on each accept or in each thread. 
[ /2]	Blocks hosts identified in the blacklist with a 403
[ /2]	Handles all lines the blacklist file 
[ /1]	Handles an empty blacklist file.
[ /2]	Ignores case with respect to both the host names and blacklist
        contents

Part 3: Multiple Clients [15/15]

[ /3]    Creates the multiple threads and passes in parameter for the file 
        descriptor to do the accept on
[ /3]    Main body is responsible for creating the socket, doing the 
        bind and the listen
[no but ok/2]    Threads don't end at the end of each request
[no but ok/2]    Main either does join on threads or infinite loop of long sleeps
[ /5]    Multiple threads actually work (i.e. they can really operate in 
        parallel and don't interfere with each other and they use, if needed
        appropriate locks)     

Part 4: Caching  [18/20]

[/2]    Only caches results that return 200
[/4]    Returns cached results
[6/8]    Handling of cache names
           Deals with names that have "/" in them
           Handles URIs that are larger than 255 
              a) hashing, must deal with collisions
              b) radix directory structure
              c) Something else
[/6]   Handles the simultaneous retrieval of the same URI - must make 
       sure that the 2nd and later retrievals don't get an intermediate 
       result

Bonus: Pictures of cats
[5/5]  Rewrites embedded IMG tags to show cats

Miscellaneous [8/10]

[ /4]  Code is appropriately commented, indented etc.
[ /4]  Structure (decomposition into functions)
[0/2]  Marker's discretion


----------MARKER COMMENTS--------------
you should really print something, both errors and logs
sometimes crashes
